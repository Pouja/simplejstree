# Simple JS tree
Like the title says, just a simple tree 'class' written in JS for one of our projects. Is this the best js tree ever? Probably no. Is this the fastest js tree ever? Maybe, everything is native, probably somethings could have been implemented better. So why bother? Well, I wanted a js tree where the parent and child identifiers are variable and I wanted to create a tree from a flat list. So I created this.

# How to use it
See the test folder.

# Can I copy it and claim it is mine?
Good luck with that, since there are probably more of these js trees on the internet, but see the licence file.
